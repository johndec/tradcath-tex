\textit{Kneel down, and say:}

\textbf{\textsc{Serviam.}}

\textsc{In} the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.
Amen.

Blessed be the holy and undivided Trinity, now and for evermore.
Amen.

\paragraph{An Act of Adoration.}
\textsc{O great} God, the sovereign Lord of heaven and earth, I prostrate
myself before Thee.  With all the Angels and Saints I adore
Thee, I acknowledge Thee to be my Creator and sovereign Lord,
my first beginning and last end.  I render to Thee the homage
of my being and life.  I submit myself to Thy holy Will,
and I devote myself to Thy divine service this day and for
ever.

\paragraph{Our Father.}
\textsc{Our} Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name.
Thy kingdom come.  Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.  And forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those who trespass against us.  And lead us not
into temptation, but deliver us from evil.  Amen.

\paragraph{Hail Mary.}

blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of
thy womb, Jesus.  Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners,
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

\paragraph{The Apostles' Creed.}
\textsc{I believe} in God, the Father almighty, Creator of Heaven and earth,
and in in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord. He was conceived by
the Holy Ghost, and born of the Virgin Mary. He suffered under Pontius
Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried. He descended into Hell.
On the third day He rose again. He ascended into Heaven, and is seated
at the right hand of God the Father Almighty. He will come again to
judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Holy
Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the
resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen. 

\paragraph{Act of Faith.}
\textsc{O my} God! I firmly believe that Thou art one God in three Divine persons,
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; I believe that Thy Divine Son became man,
and died for our sins, and that he will come to judge the living and the
dead. I believe these and all the truths which the Holy Catholic Church
teaches, because Thou hast revealed them, who canst neither deceive nor
be deceived.

\paragraph{Act of Hope.}
\textsc{O my} God! relying on Thy infinite goodness and promises, I hope to obtain
pardon of my sins, the help of Thy grace, and life everlasting, through
the merits of Jesus Christ, my Lord and Redeemer. 

\paragraph{Act of Charity.}
\textsc{O my} God! I love Thee above all things, with my whole heart and soul,
because Thou art all-good and worthy of all love. I love my neighbor as
myself for the love of Thee. I forgive all who have injured me, and ask
pardon of all whom I have injured. 

\textit{Make a firm resolution to avoid evil and to do good.}

\textsc{Adorable} Jesus! divine pattern of that perfection to which I should aspire,
I will endeavour this day to follow Thine example: to be mild, humble, chaste,
zealous, patient, charitable and resigned. Incline my heart to keep Thy
commandments. I am resolved to watch over myself with the greatest diligence,
and to live soberly, justly and piously, for the time to come. I will take
care of my words, that I may not offend with my tongue. I will turn away my
eyes that they may not see vanity; and I will be particularly attentive not
to relapse into my accustomed failings, but to struggle against them with Thy
gracious assistance. Enlighten my mind, purify my heart and guide my steps,
that I may pass all my life in Thy divine service. Amen.

\textit{In honor of the Immaculate Conception of our Blessed Lady:}

\paragraph{Hail Mary.}
\textsc{Hail}, Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee;
blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of
thy womb, Jesus.  Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners,
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

By thy pure and Immaculate Conception, O Mary, make my body pure and my soul holy.

\subsubsection*{Morning Hymn: Jam Lucis Orto Sidere}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Now that the star of light has risen, let us to God most humbly pray,
To save us from all hurtful things in all our actions of the day.
    \item To bridle and restrain our tongue, that wordy war may not resound,
To cover and protect our sight,  from dangerous follies all around.
    \item To drive iniquity away, and purify our inmost soul,
And by spare use of meat and drink, our rebel passions to control.
    \item That, when the day has sped away, and He again the night shall bring,
We may through holy abstinence, with purity His glory sing.
    \item All glory to the Father be; all praise, eternal Son to Thee;
All honor as is ever meet to God the holy Paraclete. Amen.

Let voice and mind, and heart and strength,\\
Confess and glorify Thy name,\\
And let the fire of Charity\\
Burn bright, and other hearts inflame.

\textsc{O God}, Who canst not change nor fail,\\
Guiding the hours as they roll by,\\
Brightening with beam the morning pale\\
And burning in the mid-day sky;\\
Quench Thou the fires of hate and strife,\\
The wasting fever of the heart,\\
From perils guard our feeble life,\\
And to our souls Thy peace impart.

Grant this, O Father, Only Son,\\
And Holy Ghost, God of grace,\\
To Whom all glory, Three in One,\\
Be given in every time and place. Amen.

True absolution and release:
And bless us, more than in past days,
With purity and inward peace.

Sweet fear, and sober liberty,
And simple hearts without alloy
That only long to be like Thee.

And care is light, for Thou hast cared;
Let not our works with self be soiled,
Nor in unsimple ways ensnared.

The sinful, unto Thee we call;
O let Thy mercy make us glad:
Thou art our Jesus, and our All.

Good angels watch about our home,
And we are one day nearer Thee.

one. All Saints of Heaven, come to our aid.\\

In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen.

\subsection*{The Prayer to St. Thomas for Purity}

Chosen lily of innocence, pure St. Thomas,
who kept chaste the robe of baptism,
and became an angel in the flesh after being girded by two angels,
I implore you to commend me to Jesus, the Spotless Lamb,
and to Mary, the Queen of Virgins.
Gentle protector of my purity, ask them that I,
who wear the holy sign of your victory over the flesh,
may also share your purity,
and after imitating you on earth
may at last come to be crowned with you among the angels. Amen. 

\subsection*{The Prayer of St. Thomas for Purity}

Dear Jesus,
I know that every perfect gift,
and especially that of chastity,
depends on the power of Your providence.
Without You a mere creature can do nothing.
Therefore, I beg You to defend by Your grace
the chastity and purity of my body and soul.
And if I have ever sensed or imagined anything
that could stain my chastity and purity,
blot it out, Supreme Lord of my powers,
that I may advance with a pure heart in Your love and service,
offering myself on the most pure altar of Your divinity
all the days of my life. Amen.

\subsection*{Petitions for Chastity with 15 Hail Marys:}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Dear Jesus, bless our social and cultural climate. Grant that it may be purified of everything contrary to chastity, and that we may have the strength to resist the pressures of prevailing ideologies. "In the world you have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have conquered the world" (Jn. 16:33) "In all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us" (Rom. 8:37) Hail Mary...

\item Dear Jesus, bless our relationships. Grant that they may be holy, healthy, and honorable at all times. "Having purified your souls by your obedience to the truth for a sincere love of the brethren, love one another earnestly from the heart" (1 Pet. 1:22) Hail Mary...

\item Dear Jesus, bless our modesty in our dress and movement. Grant that the way we dress and carry ourselves may veil the mystery of our being, and that we may have the strength to resist the allurements of fashion and the glamour of sin. "Do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind" (Rom. 12:2) Hail Mary...

\item Dear Jesus, bless our five senses. Grant that the things we see, the music and jokes we hear, the food we eat, what we drink, the fragrances we smell and the encounters we have through touch may all be pure and holy. "Seek the things that are above" (Col. 3:1) Hail Mary...

\item Dear Jesus, bless our sensuality. Grant that our impulses may not be captivated by base pleasures, but freed by wisdom and inflamed for what is good. "In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood" (Heb. 12:4) Hail Mary...

\item Dear Jesus, bless our imagination, Grant that we may be preserved from any fantasies that defile us, that all impure images may vanish, and that we may be protected from all the assaults of demons. "Be renewed in the spirit of your minds... Put on the whole armor of God" (Eph. 4:23, 6:11) Hail Mary...

\item Dear Jesus, bless our memory. Grant that no memories of past experiences may disturb us in any way, but that the Lord may touch and heal us through hope for a better future. "And every one who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure" (1 Jn. 3:1) Hail Mary...

\item Dear Jesus, bless our estimation. Grant that we may quickly sense dangers to chastity and instinctively flee from them, that we may never turn away from higher, more difficult, and more honorable goods for the sake of sinful self-indulgence. "Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes and where thieves do not break in and steal." (Mt. 6:19-20) Hail Mary...

\item Dear Jesus, bless our affectivity. Grant that we may love chastity and rejoice in it, that all of our emotions may cooperate in its growth, and that no sadness, discouragement, fear, insecurity, or loneliness may afflict us unto sexual sin. "For the grace of God has appeared, saving all and training us to reject godless ways and worldly desires and to live temperately, justly, and devoutly in this age, as we await the blessed hope, the appearance of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ" (Titus 2:11-12) Hail Mary...

\item Dear Jesus, bless our intellect. Grant that it may be purged of all false beliefs and misunderstandings about human sexuality and that the good angels may flood our intellects with thoughts that are gracious, pure, lovely, honorable, and true. "Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is gracious, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things." (Phil. 4:8) Hail Mary...

\item Dear Jesus, bless our will. Grant that it may never be opposed by our sensuality, that it may never be divided or conflicted in the moment, but may hold fast to chastity no matter how difficult it may be. "For the Son of God, Jesus Christ... was not Yes and No; but in him it is always Yes. For all the promises of God find their Yes in him." (2 Cor. 1:19-20) Hail Mary...

\item Dear Jesus, bless our conscience. Grant that it may be swift to judge what is the chaste thing to do, swifter to execute it, and wholly preserved from the suggestions of demons. "How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?" (Heb. 9:14) Hail Mary...

\item Dear Jesus, bless our hearts. Grant that the place where Christ abides in us with the Father and the Spirit may become the place where we live with the Holy Trinity in friendship. "Jesus answered him, 'If a man loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him.' " (Jn. 14:23) Hail Mary...

\item Dear Jesus, give us the grace of self-surrender. Grant that we may hand over to God nothing less than our whole lives. "Father, into your hands I commend my spirit" (Lk. 23:46) "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven" (Mt. 5:3) Hail Mary...

\item Dear Jesus, give us Your love. "In this is love, not that we loved God but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the expiation for our sins." (1 Jn. 4:10) "But God shows His love for us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us" (Rom. 5:8) Hail Mary...

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Closing Prayer}
Heavenly King, Consoler, Spirit of Truth, You who are everywhere present and fill all things, Treasury of all that is good, Choirmaster of Life, Come, dwell within us, cleanse us of all stain, and save our souls O Good One. Amen.

In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen.
