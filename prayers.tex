\section*{Traditional Morning Prayers}

\textit{Kneel down and making the sign of the cross, say:}

\textsc{In} the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.
Amen.

Blessed be the holy and undivided Trinity, now and for evermore.
Amen.

\subsection*{An Act of Adoration}

\textsc{O great} God, the sovereign Lord of heaven and earth, I prostrate
myself before Thee.  With all the Angels and Saints I adore
Thee, I acknowledge Thee to be my Creator and sovereign Lord,
my first beginning and last end.  I render to Thee the homage
of my being and life.  I submit myself to Thy holy Will,
and I devote myself to Thy divine service this day and for
ever.

\paragraph{Our Father}

\textsc{Our} Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name.
Thy kingdom come.  Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.  And forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those who trespass against us.  And lead us not
into temptation, but deliver us from evil.  Amen.

\paragraph{Hail Mary}

\textsc{Hail}, Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee;
blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of
thy womb, Jesus.  Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners,
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

\paragraph{The Apostles' Creed}

\textsc{I believe} in God, the Father almighty, Creator of Heaven and earth,
and in in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord. He was conceived by
the Holy Ghost, and born of the Virgin Mary. He suffered under Pontius
Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried. He descended into Hell.
On the third day He rose again. He ascended into Heaven, and is seated
at the right hand of God the Father Almighty. He will come again to
judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy
Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the
resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen. 

\paragraph{Act of Faith}

\textsc{O my} God! I firmly believe that Thou art one God in three Divine persons,
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; I believe that Thy Divine Son became man,
and died for our sins, and that he will come to judge the living and the
dead. I believe these and all the truths which the Holy Catholic Church
teaches, because Thou hast revealed them, who canst neither deceive nor
be deceived.

\paragraph{Act of Hope}

\textsc{O my} God! relying on Thy infinite goodness and promises, I hope to obtain
pardon of my sins, the help of Thy grace, and life everlasting, through
the merits of Jesus Christ, my Lord and Redeemer. 

\paragraph{Act of Charity}

\textsc{O my} God! I love Thee above all things, with my whole heart and soul,
because Thou art all-good and worthy of all love. I love my neighbor as
myself for the love of Thee. I forgive all who have injured me, and ask
pardon of all whom I have injured. 

\textit{Make a firm resolution to avoid evil and to do good.}

\textsc{Adorable} Jesus! divine pattern of that perfection to which I should aspire,
I will endeavour this day to follow Thine example: to be mild, humble, chaste,
zealous, patient, charitable and resigned. Incline my heart to keep Thy
commandments. I am resolved to watch over myself with the greatest diligence,
and to live soberly, justly and piously, for the time to come. I will take
care of my words, that I may not offend with my tongue. I will turn away my
eyes that they may not see vanity; and I will be particularly attentive not
to relapse into my accustomed failings, but to struggle against them with Thy
gracious assistance. Enlighten my mind, purify my heart and guide my steps,
that I may pass all my life in Thy divine service. Amen.

\textit{In honor of the Immaculate Conception of our Blessed Lady:}

\paragraph{Hail Mary}

\textsc{Hail}, Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee;
blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of
thy womb, Jesus.  Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners,
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

\subsection*{Morning Hymn: Jam Lucis Orto Sidere}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Now that the star of light has risen, let us to God most humbly pray,
To save us from all hurtful things in all our actions of the day.
    \item To bridle and restrain our tongue, that wordy war may not resound,
To cover and protect our sight,  from dangerous follies all around.
    \item To drive iniquity away, and purify our inmost soul,
And by spare use of meat and drink, our rebel passions to control.
    \item That, when the day has sped away, and He again the night shall bring,
We may through holy abstinence, with purity His glory sing.
    \item All glory to the Father be; all praise, eternal Son to Thee;
All honour as is ever meet to God the holy Paraclete. Amen.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Come to us Holy Spirit}

\textsc{Come} to us, Holy Spirit, come,\\
One with the Father and the Son,\\
Vouchsafe to dwell within our souls\\
And quickly make our hearts Thine own.\\
Let voice and mind, and heart and strength,\\
Confess and glorify Thy name,\\
And let the fire of Charity\\
Burn bright, and other hearts inflame.

\subsection*{O God, who canst not}

\textsc{O God}, Who canst not change nor fail,\\
Guiding the hours as they roll by,\\
Brightening with beam the morning pale\\
And burning in the mid-day sky;\\
Quench Thou the fires of hate and strife,\\
The wasting fever of the heart,\\
From perils guard our feeble life,\\
And to our souls Thy peace impart.

Grant this, O Father, Only Son,\\
And Holy Spirit, God of grace,\\
To Whom all glory, Three in One,\\
Be given in every time and place. Amen.
